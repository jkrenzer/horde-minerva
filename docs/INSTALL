This document contains instructions for installing the Minerva ...

For information on the capabilities and features of Minerva, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Minerva distribution.


Obtaining Minerva
==================

Minerva can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/minerva/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/minerva/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Minerva are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde CVS
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Minerva **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Minerva runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Minerva.

   .. Important:: Minerva 1.0 requires version 3.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Minerva's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Minerva.

2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. FOO support ``--with-foo`` [OPTIONAL]

      Description of Foo and what it is used for.

3. The following PEAR modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR modules)

   a. PEAR_Package x.x.x [OPTIONAL]

      Minerva uses the Foo_Bar class for...

4. Something else.

The following items are not required, but are strongly **recommended**:

1. Yet something else.


Installing Minerva
===================

Minerva is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory.  The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system.  Conventionally, Minerva is installed directly underneath Horde in
the web server's document tree.

Since Minerva is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/minerva-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv minerva-x.y.z minerva

and would then find Minerva at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/minerva/


Configuring Minerva
====================

1. Configuring Horde for Minerva

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['minerva']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of Minerva relative
      to Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update
      the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Configuring Minerva

   To configure Minerva, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file.  You may edit these files if you wish to customize Minerva's
   appearance and behavior.  With one exception (``foo.php``) the defaults
   will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Minerva.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to
   get to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration``
   icon to get the configuration page.  Select ``Minerva Name`` from the
   selection list of applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values
   as needed.  When done click on ``Generate Minerva Name Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Minerva configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``minerva/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Minerva uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. More instructions, upgrading, securing, etc.

4. Testing Minerva

   Once you have configured Minerva, bring up the included test page in your
   Web browser to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been met.  See
   the `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ document for further details on Horde test
   scripts.  If you installed Minerva as described above, the URL to the test
   page would be::

      http://your-server/horde/minerva/test.php

   The test script will also allow you to test...

   Next, use Minerva to....  Test at least the following:

   - Foo
   - Bar
